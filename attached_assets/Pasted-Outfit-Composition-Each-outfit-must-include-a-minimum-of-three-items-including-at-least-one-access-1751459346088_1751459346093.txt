Detailed Requirements





Wardrobe Analysis:





Analyze the user’s wardrobe to categorize items based on their suitability for different temperature ranges (e.g., warm: >25°C, mild: 15-25°C, cool: 5-15°C, cold: <5°C).



Identify items that can be layered or adapted for varying weather conditions.



Base Outfit Selection:





Select a base outfit consisting of at least three items: a top (e.g., shirt, sweater), a bottom (e.g., pants, skirt), and an accessory.



Ensure the accessory is temperature-appropriate (e.g., scarf or gloves for cold weather, sunglasses or a light hat for warm weather).



Jacket Integration:





Add a jacket that complements the base outfit in terms of style, color, and material.



Ensure the jacket suits the specified temperature (e.g., a trench coat for mild weather, a parka for cold weather).



Unique Item Inclusion:





Incorporate at least one unique item in each outfit, such as a statement piece (e.g., a bold necklace, a patterned scarf) that distinguishes the outfit from others.



Outfit Presentation:





Present the generated outfit to the user with detailed descriptions of each item (e.g., "Navy wool sweater - warm and cozy for cold days").



Provide explanations for why each item was chosen, considering temperature, occasion, and user style preferences.

Additional Considerations





User Preferences: Learn from the user’s past choices and feedback to tailor suggestions to their style and comfort.



Occasion Suitability: Ensure outfits match specified occasions (e.g., casual outings, work, formal events).



Weather Data Integration: Access real-time weather data or forecasts for the user’s location to inform temperature-based selections.



Visual Appeal: Design an intuitive, visually appealing user interface for easy outfit viewing and selection.



Privacy and Security: Securely handle personal data and wardrobe information, respecting user privacy.



Diversity and Inclusivity: Support a wide range of wardrobe items, styles, body types, and cultural preferences.

Technical Requirements





Database Access: Use a database to store and retrieve wardrobe items, user preferences, and historical data.



Image Recognition: Optionally, implement image recognition to identify and categorize wardrobe items from photos.



Efficient Processing: Ensure quick outfit generation, even for large wardrobes, for a seamless user experience.
